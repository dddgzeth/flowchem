Knauer Autosampler Control Module
=================================

This module provides an interface to control the Knauer Autosampler AS 6.1L via either Serial or Ethernet communication.
It enables users to interact with the device by sending and receiving commands, configuring parameters like tray temperature,
syringe volume, and controlling the movement of the needle and valves.

Core Features
-------------
- Support for both serial (RS-232) and TCP/IP communication.
- Full command construction and parsing for Knauer Autosampler protocol.
- Error handling and status querying from the Autosampler.
- High-level async control of tray movement, sample aspiration/dispensing, and valve positioning.

Main Components
---------------
- `KnauerAutosampler`: Main class that encapsulates the Autosampler logic. Exposes methods to set/get parameters,
  initialize the device, and perform key operations like aspiration and dispensing.
- `ASEthernetDevice`: TCP communication wrapper to interact with the Autosampler over Ethernet.
- `ASSerialDevice`: Serial communication wrapper using `aioserial` for asynchronous operation.
- `send_until_acknowledged`: Decorator that retries sending a command until acknowledged or a timeout occurs.
- `ErrorCodes`, `CommandModus`: Enums for command interpretation and error decoding.
- Custom exceptions (`ASError`, `CommunicationError`, etc.) to represent protocol-specific issues.

Dependencies
------------
- `asyncio`, `aioserial`: For asynchronous I/O communication.
- `pint`, `flowchem`: For unit handling and device integration.
- `loguru`: For logging events and error reporting.
